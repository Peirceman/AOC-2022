# [AOC-2022][1]
solution of [Advent Of code 2022][1] in [go](go.dev)

I don't know go, this is for learning it, 
so don't get mad if I do anythin wrong/strangly.

## start

put all of your inputs into the `inputs` folder
with the name `day`, the day it is for and `_test` if it is a testcase.
The day 1 input is `day1.txt`and the day 1 test input is `day1_test.txt`.

then you can just build or run it with go.
to run it, specify the day and part
and `-test` if you want to run the testcase

to run day 1 part 1 do:
```bash
 $ go build
 $ ./AOC-2022 -day=1 -part=1
```
or:
```bash
 $ go run . -day=1 -part=1
```
